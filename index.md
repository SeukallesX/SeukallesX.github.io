### CPSC 120

* Lab 3, Part 1
I found this programming exercise to be quite interesting, especially in light of my previous experience with comparable date computations that are frequently utilized in a variety of calendar countdown applications. By examining the code, I was able to identify patterns and approaches that are commonly used in programming scenarios where date differences need to be calculated. This is a concept that is commonly seen in the domain of countdowns and calendars. (Investing, charts, etc.)

* Lab 7, Part 1
In addition to strengthening my comprehension of date-related computations, this experience gave me insightful information about how to apply these algorithms in real-world settings, expanding my awareness of programming and algorithmic problem-solving.

*Lab 11, Part 1
I adored how this code includes a class that holds all of the basic information about a pizza, such as its ID, price, and caloric content. The PricePer2000Calories() function computes the price per 2000 calories and returns a figure that accounts for a unique scenario with calorie-free pizzas. This code suggests a modular, object-oriented approach to expressing and preserving pizza-related data.
